# HDetris-2015
Classic Tetris clone developed with C++ and SFML library. Written in Visual Express 2015 IDE primarily for Windows Desktop.


HDetris 2015 is a rendition of a classic Tetris game that we all know very well. Developed in about three to four months, including learning SFML multimedia libary totally from scratch.

I've set a number of goals to achieve in this application:

- Basically, it started a simple Tetris clone. 
- Then it emerged to a little more complex application, offering few game modes (as far as I can remember, code still contains complete four game modes, though only two of them actually made into actual game. Finish-time issues, you know...), each of them implements a little tweaks comparing to original game (rewritten point scoring system, very dynamic levelling, completely new block types and more... ).
- And finally, one of the most important feature to implement here for me, was to make this game very vibrant, dynamic and graphically-engaging. Kind of Tetris that was worth playing in 2015. In era of badass videogame consoles, fanstastically fast and powerful desktops as well as smartphones, I find it weird playing some tetris clones for PC or Android that don't contain any VFX spirit in it at all. I've decided to combine original (more or less) gameplay rules from Tetris (with little twists) with vibrancy, dynamism and overall eye-candism of old PSP game called Lumines (check it out!).

So, this repository's leading features are:
- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Implementation using C++ (C++11) with Visual Studio and SFML Library
- Game logic follows rule of modifying two dimentional (2D) array containing actual tetris gamespace
- Dynamism and speed twist made by myself
- Broad spectrum of gameplay modes and game pace
- Using vast variety of SFML's incredible game engine tools, some customized exclusivelly for this project needs
- Stunning, state-of-the-art techological special effects including:
- HD graphics and resolutions
- Custom painted and rendered game assets by myself in Photoshop CC
- Handful of animations and stages in game-state (dust near viewer, glowing objects, planets and stars away from viewport, space-dust strolling between gamespace, GUI, game stage scene and more, check it out!)
- Custom designed and recorded audio-effects by myself (done in Ableton Live 9 with help of in-the-box plugs along with brilliant Omnisphere and Massive workstations)
- Selection of soothing, space-y and calming ambient background music at all times, credits for original songs go to Jake Bowen of Periphery and Tycho band (applied steep equalization in mid- and high- bass frequency range combined with series of gentle compressors and limiters, designed for best audio quality result on every audio output interface)


I've moved to another project since developing this one, but feel free to ask questions, follow my profile (updates and codes for my newest games and projects!), watch this repository and general feedbacking.
I do not know a lot about creative licenses or whatnot, use whatever knowledge or pieces of code or assets you'll find here, but don't forget to PM me with link to your work if you gonna use it! And remember to mention my humble person in credits of your game ;)


I've built and run this app yesterday, just to check if everything is in place. Heads up, controls for this game are W + S + A + D + Enter key, keyboard arrows are refusing to work right now, lol'd.
